# üåü MyDailyHadith

This project embodies the noble Hadith:

> **"May Allah brighten the person who hears something from us and conveys it as he heard it, for perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed is more mindful than the hearer."**
<sub>[Authentic Hadith Narrated by At-Termedhy & Others - Sunan At-Termedhy - 2657]</sub>

MyDailyHadith automates the sharing of a daily Hadeeth in Arabic, English and French. The app leverages Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, serving as a platform to disseminate authentic Islamic knowledge effectively. This project is powered by the [HadeethEnc API](https://hadeethenc.com/en/home) and utilizes the Hadeeth dataset provided by them. **Note**: We will be pulling the most recent dataset everynow and then.
